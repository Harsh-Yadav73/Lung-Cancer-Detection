# Lung-Cancer-Detection
Lung cancer detection from histopathological images using six CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, Xception) with advanced preprocessing (edge detection, histogram equalization, blurring). Xception achieved 99.46% accuracy (99.53% fine-tuned), proving CNNs with enhancements enable accurate, automated diagnosis.
